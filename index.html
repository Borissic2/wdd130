        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Boriss Sic" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is Boriss Sic and I am from Guatemala, I love spend time with my wife and I like to play videogames. I am member of the Church since I turned 10 years old, I was the first member and missionary of my family. Being a member of this Church it had been such a wonderful decision and brought me a lot of blessings. I got maried in 2017 with the most beatiful women in this world, she is the best, she has love for everybody, it doesnt matter the time she has to meet you she will always try to give you the best of her. She is dedicated to the home and work, she always try to follow the lord and help me to understand the love of Jesus. I being working in a call center industry for about 6 years. I just started to study programing because it has a lot of field and a bright future if I follow this career. I know that it will be challengin but I am prepared and I have the support of my wife and all the people around me. I like to play videogames more than I know that should but in my defense I only was able to get a console when I grew up and that distract me in a good way. so this is a little bit about me, I hope this page can be one of thousands or more that I can create in this career.</p>
